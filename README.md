Technology Stack
------------------------------------------------

1. HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. Animate.css
2. PHP7
3. MySQL


The front-end uses simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It uses animate.css for adding animation in the application.
It uses AJAX for displaying the content without reloading the webpage.
All of the code for making the application responsive is written by us.
We're planning to remove animate.css and add our own code for animating the contents of the application.

For the back-end we're using PHP7 and MySQL database.
We're not using any PHP framework.
