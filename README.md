<h1>Attendance System</h1>

This is a web application designed to help any organization take and maintain attendance of the students
So, that faculties can take attendace of the students daily and students can check their attendance.

The whole idea revolves around making a modern and easy to use application to give organizations an upgrade
With features like Dashboard, Notification Panel we want to make it easy for the user to get relevant information easily.

<h2>Technology Used</h2>

1. HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. Animate.css
2. PHP7
3. MySQL


The front-end uses simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It uses animate.css for adding animation in the application.
It uses AJAX for displaying the content without reloading the webpage.
All of the code for making the application responsive is written by us.
We're planning to remove animate.css and add our own code for animating the contents of the application.

For the back-end we're using PHP7 and MySQL database.
We're not using any PHP framework.
